This is a program that allow users to construct villages and roads for gnomes to travel on.  The program implements Djikstra's for finding the shortest path to a certain village, since each road is associated with a weight, or the "toll."  Features such as constructing a low cost road network and obtaining passport stamps to reach a final destination are implemented using Kruskal's algorithm and topological sort.  The actions of the gnomes are controlled by a thread each.
